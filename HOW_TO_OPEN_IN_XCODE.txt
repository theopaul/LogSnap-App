HOW TO OPEN LOGSNAP IN XCODE
==============================

Since we've created all the Swift code files but not a complete Xcode project file (.xcodeproj), 
you need to create a new Xcode project and add our files to it. Here's how:

QUICK INSTRUCTIONS:
------------------

1. Open Xcode
2. Choose "Create a new Xcode project"
3. Select "App" under iOS templates
4. Fill in these details:
   - Product Name: LogSnap
   - Interface: SwiftUI
   - Life Cycle: SwiftUI App
   - Language: Swift
   - âœ“ Use Core Data
5. Choose a location to save the project
6. Click "Create"

7. Now create the folder structure in Xcode:
   - Right-click on the LogSnap folder in the Project Navigator
   - Select "New Group" for each main folder (App, Core, Data, Features, UI, Main)
   - Create subfolders within each main folder

8. Add our code files to the appropriate folders:
   - Right-click on a folder
   - Choose "Add Files to LogSnap..."
   - Navigate to where you have our code files
   - Select the files for that folder
   - Click "Add"

9. Set up localization:
   - Select your project in the Project Navigator
   - Go to the "Info" tab
   - Add "Portuguese (Brazil)" under Localizations

10. Build and run the app (press the Play button)

For detailed step-by-step instructions with visuals, open the LogSnap_Setup_Guide.html file in your web browser.

If you have any questions or encounter issues, refer to the README.md file for more details about the project structure.
